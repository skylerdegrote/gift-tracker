## About the Authors
#### Skyler DeGrote
My name is Skyler DeGrote and I am a skilled Full MEAN stack software engineer. I am the creator of this application idea and have planned it out with
wire frames and notes, which I will include later on in the READ ME file. I am 23 years old, I have a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Advertising with a minor
in Graphic Communications. I also have recently graduated from Prime Digital Academy with a certificate in Software Engineering. I take pride in my work
and enjoy working with others. I've asked a couple of my friends to help out with the application as well because I do my best work in a collaborative
environment.

#### Maria
As a fellow classmate of Skyler's, I was excited about helping Skyler with this project.  I enjoy figuring out data and we talked through how the MongoDB schema on the server-side would be be used to coexist with a great UX experience on the front-end.  In my spare time, I enjoy studying new technologies, sipping a good cup of coffee, and spending time with friends.
