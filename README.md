## About the Authors
#### Skyler DeGrote
My name is Skyler DeGrote and I am a skilled Full MEAN stack software engineer. I am the creator of this application idea and have planned it out with
wire frames and notes, which I will include later on in the READ ME file. I am 23 years old, I have a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Advertising with a minor
in Graphic Communications. I also have recently graduated from Prime Digital Academy with a certificate in Software Engineering. I take pride in my work
and enjoy working with others. I've asked a couple of my friends to help out with the application as well because I do my best work in a collaborative
environment.
